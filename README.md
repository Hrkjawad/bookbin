# Bookbin
Bookbin is a Flutter app using Firebase, created to make it easy to buy, sell, and swap books. Users can create an account to list books for sale or browse available books. By default, books are set to "buy" mode, but users can also choose a "swap" option to trade books with others. 

Payments are cash-on-delivery, meaning the seller sends the book to the buyerâ€™s address. When a book is bought, both the buyer and seller receive a notification: buyers see it in their "My Cart," and sellers see it in the "Seller Requests" section. 

If users want to swap books, they can chat to discuss and arrange the exchange. 

Users can view the books they've added, save favorite books to a wishlist, browse by category, and use filters to find books that match their interests.
